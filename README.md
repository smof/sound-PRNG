<b>sound-PRNG</b>
<br/>
<br/>
A simple (and novelty) PRNG based on taking sound samples from a laptop microphone.
<br/>
Takes a configurable amount of sound, saves as a 48bit .wav before double hashing and saving only digits into a file named myRandom
<br/>
<br/>
Limitations - this is a novelty idea, not a real PRNG for crypto purposes.  The output has never been tested or benchmarked for its quality.  Not intended for use in public places where privacy
could be inhibited.
<br/>
Use as-is, no warranty.
